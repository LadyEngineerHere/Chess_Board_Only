# Practice in Python
 In this code, we use Python to create a chessboard display. I used the colors pink and purple. You can chose your own colors based on preference from the W3school Website color picker. I also used the tradition 8x8 Chess board grid size. This was coded using Visual Studio.

# Libraries used

# Trouble Shooting in VScode
This section is for ABSOLUTE beginners. If for some reason the pygame library doesnt work, you can use your termial and enter  "pip3 install pygame" to install it OR just select interpreter Global python version (3.10.5) in Visual studio instead of the reccomended version 3.11.4. You can see what version your using on the bottom right side of the screen in Visual Studio.
